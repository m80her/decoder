					<h2>Taskrabbit</h2>
					<p>For busy people with too much work and not enough time, TaskRabbit is a helping hand. For people with plenty of time and not enough money, Taskrabbit is a great way to make a buck. With TaskRabbit you can post all manner of tasks, like picking up dry cleaning or walking the dog, and have a reliable background-checked person complete that task for you. During SXSWi, Bravo featured TaskRabbit on its interactive late night show Watch What Happens Live and partnered with the service to give away TaskRabbit credits at the conference’s events.</p>

					<h2>Pixable</h2>
					<p>With camera phones allowing us to capture every moment, it can be easy to amass thousands of photos with no way to search through them all. Pixable is a new photo app that aims to help the camera phone photographer keep all those moments at his fingertips. Along with easy searching and sorting, Pixable connects to Facebook and enables users to browse through everyone’s photos, their friends’, or just their own. At SXSWi, Pixable featured a special section that allowed attendees to see all the photos from the festival, making the new app stand out from competitors like Picplz and Instagram.</p>

					<h2>Marvel AR</h2>
					<p>Marvel is bringing a beloved niche of the print industry into the 21st century with its Marvel AR app, available on both Android and Apple’s iOS. The augmented reality app, which debuted at SXSWi, is powered by Aurasma’s augmented reality technology and uses a mobile phone’s camera lens to detect unique points of recognition in the pages of a physical comic book. It then unlocks exclusive digital and augmented reality-style content for the reader’s enjoyment. For lovers of DVD style extras, the Marvel AR app will allow fans to enjoy their favorite characters and comics in new ways.</p>

The app also manages calendars together like Eventbrite, Google Calendar, and Facebook events. Making it easier to see everything at a glance, Forecast can also make suggestions about what to do next based on your location and what you are doing. Forecast can help anyone make the most of a night out.</p>
