					<p>So what does the collegial, left-of-center town of Austin, Texas have in common with ambient discovery, cyborgs, celebrity chef Anthony Bourdain, near field communications and rap impresario Jay-Z? Well everything when you’re talking about South by Southwest Interactive (SXSWi), the one-of-a-kind super summit for all things related to social media and how interactive innovation is finding its way into every aspect of our society.</p>
					<p>In recent years, SXSWi has cemented its place in the pantheon of global gatherings pertinent to the increasingly influential digital landscape. And this year, the conference that brought us Twitter, Foursquare and Groupon among other digital mainstays, did not disappoint in giving us a peek into the future; the future of where social media, technology, brands, content, politics and creativity intersect.</p>
					<p>This issue of Decoder will give you a rich view into the highlights of this year’s event as shared by the team of expert brand leaders and digital strategists of BBDO and Proximity who attended and participated.</p>
					<p>So what stood out this year at SXSWi? As the following pages will show, this year wasn’t really dominated by any one theme but was more of a cornucopia of different topics that all stood on their own merit and brought their own distinct flavor to today’s digital agenda.  Topics ranged from the rise of the transmedia and how the practice of telling stories across different media platforms is making it’s way into big traditional media’s playbook to how mobile is leading us into a new economic age powered by seamless, hyperlocal microtransactions. And there were no shortage of speakers at this year’s SXSWi either. Everyone from Pinterest founder Ben Silbermann and former vice president Al Gore to futurist Ray Kruzweil and humorist Baratunde Thurston had interesting things to say.</p>
					<p>However, one of the most notable things at this year’s SXSWi was the meaningful presence of big brands. Unique brand-driven activations, sponsorships, receptions and parties throughout the conference marked how important it is becoming for brands of all kinds to connect with the digital innovators that only SXSWi has the ability to capture.</p>
					<p>And in addition to bringing you the key highlights from last’s month’s penultimate social media confab, this issue of Decoder will also deliver the latest and greatest news, standout creative work and new business wins from the global BBDO and Proximity networks.</p>
					<p>In truth, the following pages of Decoder is about more than just SXSWi, it’s really about what SXSWi has come to represent: the future. Our future is one in which brands, consumers and society as a whole continue to leverage digital tools to evolve and interact. And as social media matures and brings about new and unforeseen opportunities for our world, Decoder (along with SXSWi) will continue to provide an early look into what’s coming ahead.</p>
					<p>Enjoy.</p>
