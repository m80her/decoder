Proof of concept re-creating a Flash app 'magazine' in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

It's May 2012. I'm working at Redwood Publishing, and Flash is going down the pan.

Along with it is Decoder magazine, a monthly digest landing in inboxes as a link to hosted content built in Flash.

My task was to prove that CSS animations had evolved far enough to viably ditch Flash in favour of a more inclusive technology.

iOS Safari was the target browser, and the brief was fulfilled.

Not bad for 2012.
